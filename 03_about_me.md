## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

Since I stopped studying two years ago and had a work but not related to the course I started, I see git and github as a way to catch up and recall what I’ve studied two years ago. With git, I can track every change I make in my code while with github, I can create my portfolio, collaborate with others and learn from them.
